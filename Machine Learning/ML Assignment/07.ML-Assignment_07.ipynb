    "A descriptive model describes a system or other entity and its relationship to its environment.

    "Purpose: Predictive models, on the other hand, are designed to make predictions about future outcomes or behaviors based on historical data and patterns. They are forward-looking and aim to forecast what might happen under certain conditions.\n",
    "Nature: Predictive models use statistical, mathematical, or computational techniques to analyze past data and identify trends or patterns that can be extrapolated into the future. They involve making assumptions about the relationships between variables.\n",
    "Application: Predictive models find applications in various fields, such as finance, weather forecasting, machine learning, and business analytics. They are used for decision-making and planning by providing insights into potential future scenarios."

    "Definition: Underfitting occurs when a machine learning model is too simple to capture the underlying patterns in the training data. As a result, the model performs poorly on both the training and unseen data because it fails to generalize well.\n",
    "Common Reason: The most common reason for underfitting is a model that is too simple or has insufficient complexity to capture the underlying relationships in the data. It may have too few parameters or features, making it unable to learn the true patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "ii. Overfitting:\n",
    "Definition: Overfitting happens when a model is excessively complex, capturing noise or random fluctuations in the training data that do not generalize well to new, unseen data. The model performs well on the training data but poorly on new data.\n",
    "When it Occurs: Overfitting tends to occur when a model is too complex relative to the amount of training data available. It can happen when the model has too many parameters, leading it to memorize the training set rather than learning the underlying patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "iii. Bias-Variance Trade-off:\n",
    "Explanation: The bias-variance trade-off is a fundamental concept in machine learning that involves balancing two sources of error in a model: bias and variance.\n",
    "Bias: High bias occurs when a model is too simple and unable to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This leads to systematic errors, even on the training set.\n",
    "Variance: High variance occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, capturing noise and random fluctuations. This can lead to poor generalization to new data.\n",
    "Trade-off: The goal is to find the right level of model complexity that minimizes both bias and variance, striking a balance. A model that is too simple has high bias, while a model that is too complex has high variance. The challenge is to find the optimal trade-off that results in good generalization to new, unseen data."
