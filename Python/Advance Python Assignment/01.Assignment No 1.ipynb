    "It aims to implement real-world entities like inheritance, polymorphisms, encapsulation, etc. in the programming.\n",
    "The main concept of OOPs is to bind the data and the functions that work on that together as a single unit so that no other part of the code can access this data.\n",
    "It comes up with the following advantages:\n",
    "It helps to divide our over all program into different small segments and thus making it solving easy with the use of objects\n",
